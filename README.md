# Python Course Solutions

This repository contains solutions to weekly exercises for a Python programming course, focused on object-oriented programming and data manipulation using Pandas.

## Week 1: Introduction to Python
- Variables, data types, and basic operations.
- String manipulation and basic input/output.
- Conditional statements and loops.

## Week 2: Functions and Modules
- Creating and using functions.
- Importing and utilizing Python standard library modules.
- Understanding scope and recursion.

## Week 3: Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Working with sets and frozensets.
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

## Week 4: File Handling and Exceptions
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Handling exceptions with try-except blocks.
- Working with different file formats (text, CSV).

## Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming
1. **Product Class**:
    - Create a `Producto` class with attributes: `codigo`, `nombre`, `precio`, and `tipo`.
    - Implement methods to calculate total price, getters, setters, and a custom string representation.

2. **Atoms and Inheritance**:
    - Create an `Atomos` class with attributes: `simbolo`, `nombre`, `electrones`, and `numero_atomico`.
    - Implement methods to add/remove electrons and calculate the atom's charge.
    - Create subclasses `Semimetales`, `Metales`, `Radioactivos`, and `NoRadioactivos`, each with specific attributes and methods, including radiation control, magnetism, and radioactivity status.

## Week 6: Data Manipulation with Pandas
- **Pandas Basics**:
    - Introduction to Pandas: Series and DataFrames.
    - Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
    - Data analysis: groupby, aggregation, and filtering.
    - Data visualization basics using Pandas.
  
- **IMDB Data Analysis**:
    - Analyze two datasets: `imdb_elenco.csv` and `imdb_titulos.csv`.
    - Perform data manipulation and exploration, including filtering, merging, and summarizing data from the IMDB datasets.

**Note:** The `.csv` files used in Week 6 are too large to be uploaded to GitHub. If you need access to these files, please contact me directly, and I will provide them to you.
