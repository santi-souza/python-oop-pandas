# Python Course Solutions

This repository contains solutions to weekly exercises for a Python programming course, focused on object-oriented programming and data manipulation using Pandas.

## Week 1: Introduction to Python
- Variables, data types, and basic operations.
- String manipulation and basic input/output.
- Conditional statements and loops.

## Week 2: Functions and Modules
- Creating and using functions.
- Importing and utilizing Python standard library modules.
- Understanding scope and recursion.

## Week 3: Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Working with sets and frozensets.
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

## Week 4: File Handling and Exceptions
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Handling exceptions with try-except blocks.
- Working with different file formats (text, CSV).

## Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming
1. **Product Class**:
    - Create a `Producto` class with attributes: `codigo`, `nombre`, `precio`, and `tipo`.
    - Implement methods to calculate total price, getters, setters, and a custom string representation.

2. **Atoms and Inheritance**:
    - Create an `Atomos` class with attributes: `simbolo`, `nombre`, `electrones`, and `numero_atomico`.
    - Implement methods to add/remove electrons and calculate the atom's charge.
    - Create subclasses `Semimetales`, `Metales`, `Radioactivos`, and `NoRadioactivos`, each with specific attributes and methods, including radiation control, magnetism, and radioactivity status.

## Week 6: Data Manipulation with Pandas
- **Pandas Basics**:
    - Introduction to Pandas: Series and DataFrames.
    - Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
    - Data analysis: groupby, aggregation, and filtering.
    - Data visualization basics using Pandas.
  
- **IMDB Data Analysis**:
    - Analyze two datasets: `imdb_elenco.csv` and `imdb_titulos.csv`.
    - Perform data manipulation and exploration, including filtering, merging, and summarizing data from the IMDB datasets.

Each week's folder contains the Python scripts with the solutions to the exercises. The Week 6 folder also includes the `imdb_elenco.csv` and `imdb_titulos.csv` files used for data analysis. Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed.
Updated Repository Name Suggestions
Considering the addition of the IMDB datasets, you could also consider these names:

python-data-oop
python-course-exercises-imdb
bioinfo-python-datamanipulation
python-oop-pandas-imdb
These names reflect both the object-oriented programming content and the practical data analysis work using IMDB datasets.
